# This is the repo for my MIP course homework.

## Work1
Based on a literature review, summarize the development trends in the field of fundus imaging and provide an objective analysis of the gap between domestic and international levels.

## Work2

For the image provided in the attachment, perform the following experiments:

1. Window Width and Window Level Adjustment:

    Perform adjustments for Window Width (using at least two different values) and Window Level (using at least two different values).

    Provide the experimental results.

    Analyze the function and significance of Window Width and Window Level.

2. Histogram Equalization:

    Perform a histogram equalization operation (the choice of algorithm is not limited).

    Describe the underlying principle of the algorithm.

    Provide the experimental results, including: the images before and after equalization, their corresponding grayscale histograms, and their cumulative histograms.
